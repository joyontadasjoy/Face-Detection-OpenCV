    <h1>Face Detection using OpenCV </h1>
    <p>This is a Python script that uses the OpenCV library to detect human faces in real-time using the Haar Cascade Classifier algorithm. The script captures video from the default webcam and applies the classifier to detect any human faces in the frame. If a face is detected, a green rectangle is drawn around it with the text "Human Face" written above it.</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>To use this script, you will need to install the following libraries:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>OpenCV</li>
      <li>Numpy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:</p>
    <code>pip install opencv-python numpy</code>
    
   <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>To run the script in a Jupyter Notebook, first make sure you have installed OpenCV and Numpy using pip as described above. Then, open a new notebook in Jupyter and copy the code from the script into a new cell. Make sure to run the cell to import the necessary libraries and define the functions.</p>
    <p>Once you have copied the code into a cell, you can run the script by executing the cell. When the script is running, it will open a window showing the video stream from your webcam. If a human face is detected, a green rectangle will be drawn around it with the text "Human Face" written above it.</p>
